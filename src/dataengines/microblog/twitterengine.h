/**
 * Twitter Data Engine
 *
 * This engine provides access to twitter.com timelines.
 * There are two types of timeline you can connect to:
 * Timeline:<user>
 * TimelineWithFriends:<user>
 *
 * Timeline:<user> shows only the tweets of that user. it currently requires a password.
 * TimelineWithFriends:<user> shows the normal timeline of that user and their
 * friends. it requires a password to be configured for the user.
 *
 * To configure a password, use setConfig(user, password).
 *
 * For each source you connect to, you should also connect to Error:<source> to see http errors.
 * You should also connect to the Error source for general errors.
 *
 * If you need to display user images, the UserImages source provides a list of
 * all images, and LatestImage provides just the most recently downloaded one.
